## ðŸš€ Initialize and Push Your First File

- Create a new directory and initialize Git:

# mkdir my-first-repo
# cd my-first-repo
# git init

- Create your first file:
# echo "# Hello GitHub" > README.md

- Stage and commit the file:

# git add README.md

# git commit -m "Initial commit with README"

- Connect to your GitHub repo:

# git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git

- Push to GitHub:

# git push -u origin main


Replace your-username and your-repo with your actual GitHub details. If your default branch is master, swap main with master.
